# Inverted-Search
Inverted Search that indexes words across multiple text files. Uses singly linked lists where each node stores a unique word and a sublist of files containing it. Supports case-insensitive search, avoids duplicates, validates input files, and efficiently retrieves all files containing a queried word, emphasizing file handling, string manipulation.
